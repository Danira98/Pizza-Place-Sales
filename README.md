# Pizza Place Sales

## Overview and Purpose of Project
We are given a large data set of a pizza establishment in which we have all of their sales data for the year of 2015 and we are given the task to create a report in which we can give the owners an insight into how their business is doing and where they can improve.

Questions To be answered: 

- How many customers do we have each day? Are there any peak hours?
- How many pizzas are typically in an order? Do we have any bestsellers?
- How much money did we make this year? Can we indentify any seasonality in the sales?
- Are there any pizzas we should take of the menu, or any promotions we could leverage?
